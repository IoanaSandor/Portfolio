        <p>These videos were made to illustrate common accidents that can happen on machines in the factory and encourage factory workers to follow safety procedures. 5 videos were made in total. Below are the three best executed ones. <br><br>
        I modeled all the parts and the character model, textured, rigged, and animated the models, lit the scenes, rendered, and assembled the renders in post production.</p>

   <h2>process</h2>
   <div class="info">
     <p class="process-desc">I started by modeling the character model. This was my first time modeling a person so I had to find a lot of anatomical resources. The company provided me with reference photos of a coworker so that I could model the character off of them. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <p class="process-desc">After getting the character modeled, I textured him, then added bones and controllers.</p>

      </div>
   </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">After that was done, I began animating various videos that were given to me. I modeled the rest of the parts for the videos and made the lighting and environments. There were 5 in total.</p>

<h2>final thoughts</h2>
<div class="info">
  <p class="process-desc">Each video presented a new and different challenge for me; however, the hardest part of each film was the rigging and animation of the human character. This was my first time rigging and the moves I required the character to do were too extreme to use IK riggs, so I had to manually key every single bone. A lot of the videos primarily focused on the hands, which had many bones.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="info">
   <p class="process-desc">Working with the particle systems for the 5th case video was a lot of fun because at that point I had a much better understanding of how particle systems worked; therefore, I was able to finish the particle system very fast and spend a lot more time adjusting the finer details of it. </p>
