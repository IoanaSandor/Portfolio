      <div class="summary">
        <p>For this assignment, I was tasked with creating an animation that displayed basic body mechanics. This was the first time I worked with constraints and switching from IK to FK controls within the same animation.</p>

   <!-- Process -->
   <h2>process</h2>
   <div class="info">
     <p class="process-desc">I first started by filming reference footage for my animation. I chose to try animating a character lifting a heavy object. In order to get as much realism as possible, I filmed myself picking up a 45 lb weight. The pained look in the video is very genuine! This realism resulted in very good reference; however, I had to be careful as I could only do a couple takes before I became too tired. This also hurt me later in the process as I did not properly pick a good final camera angle when I filmed.</p><br>

  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">Once I finished studying my reference material, I began blocking from both the side and the front. Because of how large the head was on my model, it made it hard to see what the body was doing as I was animating it. I chose to hide the head while working. My mentor later mentioned that although this is good for workflow, it is not acceptable for shots that are presented to a team.</p><br>

  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">I moved into spline a bit too early as my breakdowns were not fully defined and my final camera angle had not quite been chosen. This really hurt my progress as I lost a week's worth of work due to poor planning.</p><br>

  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">In order to get back on track, I chose a much better camera angle, re-did a couple of my key poses in stepped keys, and then began the splining process once again.</p><br>

  </div>

<h2>final thoughts</h2>
<div class="info">
  <p class="process-desc">I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that I went so astray in one of the weeks I had to work on this project. However, I learned the VERY important lesson of committing to a good camera angle quite early in the process and letting said camera angle guide posing and arcs. Apart from that, I really felt like I achieved some semblance of weight within the animation, on top of which, I got quite comfortable taking my own reference footage.</p>
