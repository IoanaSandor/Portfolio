      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this assignment, I was tasked with demonstrating intermediate body mechanics. I really wanted to challenge myself and try animating with a different rig so I chose Stan. This also presented the opportunity to have some fun with the acting of the shot.</p>

   <!-- Process -->
   <h2>process</h2>
   <div class="info">
     <p class="process-desc">The first thing I did was plan and film reference. As my workflow has developed, I've taken a liking to planning directly on my reference material with the help of programs like SyncSketch. In my reference, I tried to be as authentic to my animation mechanics wise as possible by carrying a light object as the chair, making sure it was much smaller than my body, and by wearing proper shoes so the steps would feel authentic. I also set up two camera angles and aligned the footage in order to get multiple angles for reference.</p><br>

  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">After my basic planning was done, I began roughly blocking my key poses and committing to a shot cam very early in the process.</p><br>
    <img class="process-img" src="img/oh_how_cute/rough_blocking.gif" title="Oh How Cute Rough Blocking" alt="A rough blocking pass of the Oh How Cute animation">
  </div>

  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">Once my rough blocking was done and approved by my mentor, I polished my blocking and made sure to define my breakdowns in preparation for moving from stepped to spline.</p><br>
    <img class="process-img" src="img/oh_how_cute/polished_blocking.gif" title="Oh How Cute Polished Blocking" alt="A polished blocking pass of the Oh How Cute animation">
  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">After I polished my blocking, I did an very rough pass in spline. The animation was in very rough shape at this point and I had a lot of work ahead of me.</p><br>

  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">I started cleaning up my curves and getting a better sense of my timing as I kept refining. At this point, I started adding small flourishes that added personality like the scrunched facial expression and the approving nod.</p><br>

  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p class="process-desc">At this stage, I added more polished gestures like the way Stan let go of the chair after initially setting it down and the delicate way he adjusts it. This is also when I really started cleaning up my arcs and added a simple animation on the squirrel as well.</p><br>

<h2>final thoughts</h2>
<div class="info">
  <p class="process-desc">Although I see so many areas in which more polish could be added, I am happy with this animation. I really enjoyed the challenges of posing a character with such odd proportions. It felt so satisfying when I solved issues pertaining to his large hands, small head, and tiny feet. Furthermore, by giving this character a strong personality and intention from the beginning, it really made acting choices and details a lot of fun and purposeful. All in all, I believe that this was a great start to a mechanics shot!</p>
